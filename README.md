# ProbeControlUnlimiterContinued
This is the continuation of a KSP mod that provides full control for probes without signal while CommNet is not disabled.

## Warning
Needs ModuleManager to take effect.
It disables hibernation option as it would not make the control limited!

## Info about the fork
I forked this mod because I wanted to compile it against 1.12.5 and I wanted to learn how KSP modding works.  
I've also added a menu entry to enable/disable the mod so that I at least added something of worth.

## Motivation
I role play the flight computer of my probe. So the fact that I can't control the probe while not having communication with Kerbin does not fit my gameplay.  
However disabling the CommNet allows to transmit science all the time and is not compatible with the other mods I use (Kerbalism and Real Antennas).  
I don't understand why this isn't possible in the base game but that's why there are mods.
